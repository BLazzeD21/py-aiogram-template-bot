# Template for creating a telegram bot using the aiogram framework

This bot was created for educational purposes and is a template with examples of using various functionality of the aiogram 3 framework for creating telegram bots. In this example, a bot with a registration form is implemented. You can register, view your profile and view the profiles of other users. Try, study, change existing functionality and add new ones!

**This template has:**
- virtual environment,</br>
- custom filters,</br>
- environment variables,</br>
- bot configuration,</br>
- strict modularity,</br>
- routers,</br>
- replyKeyboards,</br>
- inlineKeyboards,</br>
- setMyCommands,</br>
- callback Factory,</br>
- SQLite databases,</br>
- FSM based on redis,</br>
- Custom pagination.</br>

# Bot structure üìÅ
Folder  | Description
------------- | -------------
config  | Configuration files, database
filters  | Admin filter
handlers  | Handlers of commands and callbacks
keyboards | Dynamically generated keyboards
lexicon  | Dictionary with all text
logs | Storage of all logs
middlewares  | Middlewares for antispam and etc.
models  | Modules for interacting with the database
states  | Modules that describe classes that reflect the possible states of<br>users during interaction with the bot, for the implementation of FSM
utils  | Functions that run multiple times

# Development üõ†

### 1. To create a virtual environment:

- For windows - ```python -m venv venv```
- For macOS & Linux - `python3 -m venv venv`

### 2. The virtual environment is activated with the command:

- For windows - `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
- For Power Shell - `venv\Scripts\activate.ps1`
- For macOS & Linux - `source venv/bin/activate`

### 3. To install all dependencies in a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. To add new dependencies:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### 5. How to leave the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

### 6. How to launch a bot:

- For windows - `py start.py`
- For macOS & Linux - `python3 start.py`

If you want the bot to automatically restart every time you save files, you can use the [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) tool:

```bash
npm i -g nodemon
```

You can launch the bot via:

```bash
nodemon --exec py/python3 start.py
```


# Deploying a bot üíæ

### 1. Docker installation
   **‚ùóÔ∏è Important**
   
  Before starting installation, check the system requirements:
  - 64-bit architecture
  - kernel no lower than version 3.10 (suitable for Ubuntu version 16.04 and higher)

  Update the existing package list:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  ```

  Install a few necessary packages that allow `apt` to use packages over HTTPS:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
  ```

  Add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
  ```

  Add the Docker repository to the APT sources:
  ```bash
  sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
  ```

  Update the package database and add the Docker packages from the newly added repository:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  ```

  Install Docker:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install docker-ce
  ```

  Docker must be installed. Check that it is running:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status docker
  ```

### 2. Installation make

  You need to update packages and install make on the server:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install make
  ```

  Check the installed version:
  ```bash
  make -v
  ```

### 3. Docker container
 Go to the bot repository:
  ```bash
  cd name
  ```
  
  To create a container image you need:
  ```bash
  make build
  ```

  To start a container:
  ```bash
  make run
  ```
